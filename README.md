## Lex Technical Showcase

Thanks for applying to work at Lex! Next we’d like to learn a little more about your technical experience and abilities.

### Code submission

Share some code that you’re proud of and that you feel showcases your abilities.
- It should be either something you alone wrote, or if you collaborated with others on it, please describe the collaboration and point us to a piece of it that you alone wrote.
- It can be in any language, and does not have to relate to Lex or mobile app development at all.
- We’re looking at the code itself - don’t worry about the state of the repository or if it’s deployed or not.
- Include a summary or readme that gives context to the project. Tell us why you picked it, and elaborate on how you could further improve it.
- Directly send or provide access to your submission however you’d like. If you’d like to share a private repo, invite [`@junebugfix`](https://github.com/junebugfix) to it.

### Q&A

Please respond to the following prompts. Your responses don't have to be super long - don't spend more than 5-10 minutes on each question.

1) What’s an idea or principle that you’ve learned that made you a better programmer? Why?

2) Two technologies we use are nodejs and typescript. What do you like or dislike about these and their eco-systems? What things are they well suited for? Could they be improved?

3) The product team comes to you and says they want you to implement group chat in the app. What questions would you ask? What technical challenges do you foresee and how could you mitigate them?

Note: if writing isn't your thing, audio or video responses are also fine.

Please submit your responses to `jobs@lex.lgbt`
